	The directory structure and main files are:

	HAPI_Start - contains the Visual Studio solution file (.sln)
		HAPI_Start - contains the Visual Studio HAPI_APP project file (.vcxproj) and source code
			HAPI - the directory with all the HAPI library files
			Data - a place to put your data files with a few sample ones provided

	Additionally in the top directory there is a batch file for creating a redistributable Demo folder
