// CURRENTLY WORKING ON INTERACTION
// PLAN IS TO CREATE A LISTENER FOR WHEN THE USER PRESSES THE INTERACTION BUTTON
// Issue is once the listener has called their interact function and determined whether or not the player is interacting with them is how to then set the bool values in player.
// IE. When the player interacts with the seed box how do we then call the SetSeedsTrue function in player?

// - Need to show player has seeds when true
